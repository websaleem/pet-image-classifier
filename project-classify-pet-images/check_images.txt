Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All the three model correctly classify the breed of dog as 'burneese mountain dog' in Dog_01.jpg


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG architecture model correctly classify the same breed of the dog in the Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg. However, the AlexNet model classify the Dog_02.jpg as the 'appenzeller'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all the three model correctly classify that the Green_tree_frog_01.jpg and Coffee_mug_01.jpg are not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The ResNet and VGG model did best to classify the four uploaded images, but the AlexNet failed to correctly classify the breed for Dog_02.jpg. However, ResNet just taken approx half time as compared to VGG model. 
Therefore, the ResNet model seems best for these 4 input images and it does really good job in classifying 100% for dog images and with shortest time.
